<analysis>**original_problem_statement**: The user wants to build the EKA-AI Platform, an AI chat application for automobile intelligence. The project started from a user-provided frontend codebase (React/Vite/TypeScript). The initial request was simply BUILD THIS APP.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS (Evolved through conversation):**
1.  **Tech Stack:** Use FastAPI and MongoDB for the backend. The AI chat feature must use the Emergent LLM Key.
2.  **Login Page:**
    *   It must be the application's main entry point, replacing any landing page.
    *   The design should mimic the Claude.ai login page: a two-panel layout with a beige/cream background on the left and a media panel on the right.
    *   It must be fully responsive (desktop, tablet, mobile).
    *   The header should display the EKA-AI mascot and brand name, not a Claude logo.
    *   The main tagline (The AI for...) should have an animated typing effect and change daily.
3.  **Feature Showcase:**
    *   The right panel of the login page must be a feature carousel, not a single video.
    *   This carousel should highlight key app features: PDI Process, MG Model, Job Card to Invoice, AI Chat, and Marketing Tools.
4.  **Interactive Demos:**
    *   Each slide in the carousel must have a Watch Demo button.
    *   Clicking this button should open an interactive demo modal.
    *   These demos must be video-like recordings of the *actual, live application*, not just mockups.
    *   The demos should include smooth transition animations between steps and zoom/highlight effects on key UI elements.
    *   Demos must cover multiple workflow states, including filled forms and success messages.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack EKA-AI application. The backend is FastAPI with MongoDB, serving APIs for AI chat (via Emergent LLM Key), user authentication, and job cards. The frontend is a responsive Vite/React/TypeScript application featuring a sophisticated login page with a feature carousel. This carousel opens interactive, video-like demos built from animated sequences of real application screenshots for features like AI Chat, Job Card management, and more.

**Last working item**:
*   **Last item agent was working**: Enhancing the interactive demos by capturing more workflow states. The agent was specifically trying to capture the success screen after submitting the New Job Card form to create a complete A-to-Z recording of that workflow.
*   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
*   **Agent Testing Done**: N
*   **Which testing method agent to use?**: Screenshot tool to capture the required UI states, followed by manual verification of the new demo animations.
*   **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
*   **Issue 1**: Job Cards page sometimes loads as a blank/dark screen (P0)
*   **Issue 2**: The PDI/Artifacts page is not interactive (P1)
*   **Issue 3**: Job Card statistics on the dashboard are incorrect (P2)

**Issues Detail**:
*   **Issue 1**:
    *   **Attempted fixes**: The agent previously added null checks in  and  to handle cases where API data might be undefined. This fixed the issue temporarily, but it has recurred.
    *   **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  Examine the network response for  when the page fails to load.
        2.  Add more robust error handling and a loading state in .
        3.  Verify that the  correctly parses the response and handles potential API errors gracefully.
    *   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: The Job Cards page is a core feature. Fixing this ensures users can reliably access and manage their workshop jobs.
    *   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    *   **Is recurring issue?**: Y
    *   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Both
    *   **Blocked on other issue**: None

*   **Issue 2**:
    *   **Attempted fixes**: None. The agent only discovered the issue while trying to capture screenshots.
    *   **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  Review the code in .
        2.  Find the  handlers for the New artifact button and the PDI tool cards.
        3.  Implement or fix the logic to open the corresponding PDI form/modal.
    *   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: The PDI (Pre-Delivery Inspection) process is a key feature showcased on the login page. This functionality needs to work in-app to match the demo.
    *   **Status**: NOT STARTED
    *   **Is recurring issue?**: N
    *   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend
    *   **Blocked on other issue**: None

*   **Issue 3**:
    *   **Attempted fixes**: None. The agent identified the likely cause but did not implement a fix.
    *   **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  In , inspect the  endpoint.
        2.  Compare the status strings used in the aggregation query (e.g., IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED) with the status strings the frontend expects in .
        3.  Align the status names in the backend and frontend.
    *   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: This will provide users with an accurate, at-a-glance summary of their operations on the dashboard.
    *   **Status**: NOT STARTED
    *   **Is recurring issue?**: N
    *   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Both
    *   **Blocked on other issue**: None

**In progress Task List**:
*   **Task 1**: Complete the Interactive Demo Recordings (P0)

**Task Detail**:
*   **Task 1**:
    *   **Where to resume**: In , the agent needs to successfully submit the New Job Card form. This requires filling in all mandatory fields (including Customer Name) before programmatically clicking the Create Job Card button to capture the success message screenshot.
    *   **What will be achieved with this?**: The interactive demos will showcase complete, realistic user workflows, enhancing the login page experience. After capturing the states, the next step is to add zoom and highlight animations within .
    *   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    *   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend
    *   **Blocked on something**: Blocked on successfully submitting the form to capture the success state screenshot.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**

*   **Upcoming Tasks**:
    *   **(P1) Implement PDI/Artifacts page interactivity**: Make the PDI section of the  page functional by adding the necessary forms and modals.
    *   **(P2) Fix Job Card stats display**: Align backend status names with the frontend to show correct counts on the  dashboard.

*   **Future Tasks**:
    *   Implement an Export to MP4 feature for the interactive demos.
    *   Add a guided product tour for first-time users.
    *   Enhance the user sign-up process to collect workshop-specific details (e.g., GST number, address).

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
*   **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
*   **Backend**: Python, FastAPI, MongoDB ()
*   **AI Integration**: Emergent LLM Key with the  library for Gemini.
*   **Architecture**: Monorepo with a Vite proxy routing  requests from frontend to backend.

**key DB schema**
*   **job_cards**: 
*   **users**: 
*   **chat_sessions**: 

**changes in tech stack**
*   **Database Migration**: The original codebase used PostgreSQL (Supabase), which was replaced with MongoDB.

**All files of reference**
*   **/app/frontend/src/components/DemoModal.tsx**: Contains the complex logic for the interactive, video-like demos. It was newly created and is central to the latest user requests.
*   **/app/frontend/src/pages/LoginPage.tsx**: The main app entry point, heavily modified to include the new design and feature carousel.
*   **/app/frontend/src/components/FeatureVideoCarousel.tsx**: The component for the feature slider on the login page.
*   **/app/backend/server.py**: A single file containing the entire backend logic.
*   **/app/frontend/src/pages/JobCardsPage.tsx**: A core page that has been buggy and required fixes to handle API data correctly.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
*   The  file is monolithic and contains all API logic. It should be broken down into multiple files using FastAPI's  for better organization (e.g., , ).
*   The  component has all demo steps and data hardcoded. This could be refactored into a more data-driven system where demo scripts are defined in separate configuration files.

**key api endpoints**
*   : Handles AI chat requests.
*   : User authentication.
*   : Retrieves all job cards.
*   : Creates a new job card.
*   : Retrieves job card statistics.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
*   The frontend project structure was messy. The agent correctly migrated a Vite project into the  directory, which was previously configured for Create React App. Ensure you understand that the frontend is now a Vite project run with yarn run v1.22.22

*   The interactive demos are the most complex feature. They are not videos but a sequence of screenshots animated using CSS and Framer Motion in . All data (steps, images) is hardcoded there.
*   The Job Cards page () is fragile and has had recurring rendering issues. Test this page carefully after making any related changes.

**Project Health Check:**
*   **Broken**:
    *   **Job Cards Page**: Prone to rendering as a blank screen due to data-handling errors on the frontend.
    *   **PDI Functionality**: The PDI section on the  page is not interactive; buttons and links do not work.
*   **Mocked**:
    *   **Interactive Demos**: The videos are actually sophisticated, animated slideshows of real screenshots controlled by , not actual video files.

**3rd Party Integrations**
*   **Gemini** — uses Emergent LLM Key for the AI Chat Assistant.

**Testing status**
*   **Testing agent used after significant changes**: YES
*   **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop**: NO
*   **Test files created**: []
*   **Known regressions**: The Job Cards page rendering issue has recurred after being fixed once.

**Credentials to test flow:**
*   User registration is open. You can create a new user via the login page UI to test the application flow.

**What agent forgot to execute**
*   The agent identified that the job card stats on the  page were incorrect due to a mismatch in status names between the frontend and backend. However, it did not fix this issue and moved on to other tasks.</analysis>
