## Payment confirmation

EKA-AI activates paid access **only after PayU confirms your payment**.

Sometimes you will see **Payment pending** after you return from PayU. This means we are still waiting for PayU’s confirmation.

If it stays pending for more than a few minutes, email **connect@eka-ai.in**. Include your payment reference (`txnid`) and the email used at checkout.
