# Diagnostics & Troubleshooting

### How EKA-AI helps

* Suggests checks in sequence.
* Asks for missing signals.
* Avoids high-risk advice without context.

### Root cause protocol (pattern)

1. Confirm symptoms.
2. Collect vehicle context (brand, model, year, fuel type).
3. Run the minimum safe checks.
4. Narrow down causes.
5. Recommend next action.

{% hint style="info" %}
If confidence is below **0.90 (90%)**, EKA-AI should not guess. It should ask targeted questions and request missing evidence.
