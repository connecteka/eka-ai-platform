# How to Chat with EKA-AI

### Best prompts

Ask with context. Use short, specific inputs.

Good:

* “Swift Dzire 2019 petrol. Overheating at idle. No coolant leak. Next checks?”
* “Draft a customer update for job card 123. Vehicle ready for customer approval (digital signature).”
* “Estimate only: what are the likely parts and labor items? Use pricing catalogs for final prices.”

Avoid:

* Vague questions without vehicle details
* Requests outside automotive workflows
* Requests for exact prices (final prices come from pricing catalogs)

### Use job card context

EKA-AI is most accurate inside a job card. It can use:

* vehicle profile
* inspection artifacts
* notes and evidence

For technical guidance, include:

* brand
* model
* year
* fuel type
