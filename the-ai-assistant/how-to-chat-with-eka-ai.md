# How to Chat with EKA-AI

### Best prompts

Ask with context. Use short, specific inputs.

Good:

* “Swift Dzire 2019 petrol. Overheating at idle. No coolant leak. Next checks?”
* “Draft a customer update for job card #123. Vehicle ready for approval.”

Avoid:

* Vague questions without vehicle details
* Requests outside automotive workflows

### Use job card context

EKA-AI is most accurate inside a job card. It can use:

* vehicle profile
* inspection artifacts
* notes and evidence
