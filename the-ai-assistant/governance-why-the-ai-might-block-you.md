# Governance: Why the AI might "Block" you

EKA-AI blocks requests to keep outputs safe. This is expected.

### Common block reasons

* Out of automotive domain
* Missing context (vehicle details)
* Low confidence
* Missing permissions

### What the UI should do

* Show the reason in one sentence.
* Ask for the missing info.
* Offer the next allowed action.

{% hint style="info" %}
Blocks are part of the 4-gate constitution. See [The "4-Gate" Safety System (The Constitution)](../introduction/the-4-gate-safety-system-the-constitution.md).
{% endhint %}
