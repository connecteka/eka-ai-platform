# Digital Signatures & Customer Approvals

Customer approval (digital signature) is part of governance.

It protects both the customer and the workshop.

### Recommended rules

* Capture digital signature plus timestamp.
* Store the approval payload immutably.
* Store it against the job card.
* Always show what was approved (scope and totals).

### UX tips

* Keep the signature step fast.
* Support mobile signing.
* Provide a shareable approval link if needed.
