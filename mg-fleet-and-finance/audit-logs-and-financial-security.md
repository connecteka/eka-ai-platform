# Audit Logs & Financial Security

Finance needs an audit trail. Make it hard to change history.

### What to log

* Pricing catalog changes (parts catalog and labor catalog)
* Invoice draft creation and edits
* Invoice finalization
* Customer approval (digital signature)
* Owner approvals for finance-impacting actions
* Payment events (PayU)

### Controls to implement

* Role-based permissions (Owner vs Technician)
* Immutable event logs
* Alerting on suspicious changes
