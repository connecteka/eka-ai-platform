# Executive Overview

### Vision

Remove OEM monopoly over data, diagnostics, and service workflows.

Shift leverage to workshops, fleets, and insurers.

### Mission

Democratize AI for the automobile ecosystem.

Make diagnostics, governance, and finance-grade workflows accessible.

### What EKA-AI is

EKA-AI is a multi-tenant automobile AI operating system.

It ships governed workflows for:

* job cards
* diagnosis assistance
* approvals and evidence
* GST-compliant invoicing
* fleet MG billing

### Industry positioning

EKA-AI sits between three layers:

* **Operations OS** for workshops.
* **Governance layer** for audit-grade actions.
* **AI orchestration layer** for domain assistance.

The differentiator is governance, not “chat”.

### Platform sovereignty strategy

EKA-AI treats sovereignty as a product feature.

* Tenant isolation is non-negotiable.
* Pricing is deterministic and auditable.
* AI is constrained by platform law.
* Data export is supported for customer control.

{% hint style="info" %}
EKA-AI’s AI is a governor. It is not the engine. Deterministic services do pricing, tax, and state changes.
