# Investor narrative (deck backbone)

### Problem

Automotive service is fragmented.

OEMs control diagnostics and data.

Workshops and fleets lack leverage.

### Thesis

The winning platform owns workflow + governance.

AI without governance is a liability.

### Solution

EKA-AI is a governed automobile OS.

It standardizes:

* job card → estimate → approval → invoice
* evidence capture for disputes
* deterministic finance engines

### Moat

* constitution-first AI.
* deterministic pricing and tax engines.
* audit-grade artifacts.
* multi-tenant isolation as a core primitive.

### Market entry

Start with workshops.

Expand into fleets and insurers.

Add marketplace + white-label for distribution.

### Business model

* plan-based SaaS.
* paid add-on modules (fleet, insurance, parts).
* usage-based AI where required.
* marketplace revenue share.

### Risk controls

* platform law prevents unsafe outputs.
* approvals are first-class.
* invoices are structured and provable.
* audit logs are append-only.

### What to show in a live demo

* create job card
* generate estimate draft
* collect approval
* finalize GST invoice
* show audit trail
